# TRUMP

TRUMP (**T**ile **R**otating **U**niversal **M**ap **P**resentation) is a project that aims to bring rotation invariant vector labeling to maps representations. The goal is to display the same labels to the viewer regardless of current rotation to benefit the user's ability to navigate.

## Project Description
The software presented on this website and the related github repositories of [client](https://github.com/trump-fmi/ol-labels) and the [label-server](https://github.com/trump-fmi/osm_label_server) were created in the context of a  software development student-project conducted at the university of stuttgart. The papers [Growing Balls in RD](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611974768.20) and [Crushing Discs Effciently](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44543-4_4) provide the underlying research and enable the preprocessing of OpenStreetMap data.
